<summary><strong>System Components</strong></summary>

## System Components
1. **Web Server (Django)**  
   - Manages API development and database interactions.
   - Provides RESTful APIs using Django REST Framework.

2. **Frontend (React)**  
   - Manages user interface, built with React and TypeScript.
   - Provides responsive design using TailwindCSS.

3. **Database (MySQL)**  
   - Stores employee data, attendance logs, payroll information, etc.
   - Designed with scalability and relational modeling in mind.

4. **Containerization (Docker)**  
   - Maintains development environment consistency and minimizes deployment issues.
   - Backend, Frontend, and Database are managed with Docker Compose.

5. **CI/CD (GitHub Actions)**  
   - Automatically builds and tests upon code push.
   - Deploys automatically when merged into the main branch.

6. **Monitoring & Logging (Sentry, ELK)**  
   - Real-time error monitoring via Sentry.
   - Log collection and analysis through the ELK Stack.

<summary><strong>Why these choices?</strong></summary>

## Why these choices?  
- **Django**: Chosen for its scalability, security, and rapid development capabilities. Django's ORM (Object Relational Mapping) efficiently handles database management.  
- **React**: Enables modular and reusable UI components, supporting rapid front-end development.  
- **Docker**: Ensures consistent development and deployment environments.  
- **MySQL**: Strong ACID compliance ensures reliable transactional data storage.  
- **GitHub**: Streamlines version control, collaboration, and CI/CD integration.
